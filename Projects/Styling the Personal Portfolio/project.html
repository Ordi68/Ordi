              In this project I have presented one of the most beautiful countries in the world.
             A country that has natural beauty and a traditional culture. I suggest you go to this place, it's worth it.

                In this project I have presented the tables I have presented in Excel. 
                Here I've presented them tabelically and graphically for the store's spending list. Excel is a great way to work the charts

              In this project I told of the bomb which was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 and Nagaskai on August 9, 1945.
                 These two cities have been launched two very large bombs. A story that's very interesting to hear.
